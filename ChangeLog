2004-10-07	Jason Lerch	<jason@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* added missing methods to the various POD files.

	when the stagename was a partial version of another stage,
	i.e. "pve" and "pve_curvature".

2004-10-01	Jason Lerch	<jason@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	pictures.

2004-08-16	Jason Lerch	<jason@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* added ability to use only a subset of stages. Not the greatest
	implementation yet, as inclusion of siblings in the stage
	hierarchy is arbitrary. Only a single to stage can be specified at
	this point in time.

	* added pipeline status report printing functions

2004-08-01	Jason Lerch	<jason@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

2004-07-31 	Jason Lerch	<jason@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* added methods to print a CSV separated status file. Both PMP.pm
	and PMParray are affected.

	* added this ChangeLog file
