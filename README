documentation for all the gory details.

Installation: copy the .pm and .pod files somewhere and set your
PERL5LIB environment to reflect that location.

CVS: The following tags exist or are planned:

milestone3 [planned: * = undone, + = done.]:
* additiong of -to type specification of resetting of stages
* pretty printing of stages
* documentation of which methods affect the actual filesystem and
which ones are safe to run.
* correct installation of modules.
* automation of startup tasks in PBSarray.pm
* announcement to BIC community.

milestone2: addition of lots of documentation. Announced to a small
group of people for feedback on the design.

milestone1: first version that appears to run with no known bugs. That
of course does not mean that there are no bugs (they are in fact still
likely), but all test cases run the way that they should.
