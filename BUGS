When job is killed and rerun the batch queues are not first cleared -
not sure if this is a bug or a feature ...

If one job fails I don't think it keeps processing those that it can
keep processing. Not sure if this bug is true, but should lookm into it.

Nicer formatting of the printStage command would not hurt.
